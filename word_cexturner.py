# Issues and solutions
issues = [
    ("Alignment and Calibration Issues", 
     "Problem: The spectrometer’s optical components (mirror, grating, detector) need to be well-aligned for accurate measurements. If they are misaligned, the data may be distorted.\n"
     "Solution: Ensure the spectrometer is calibrated before starting. Check the alignment of the optical components and refer to the user manual for procedures. Calibrate the wavelength scale if needed."),
    
    ("Sample Positioning and Stability", 
     "Problem: If the sample is not correctly positioned or if it moves during the measurement, you can get inaccurate data or noise.\n"
     "Solution: Secure your sample properly. Use sample holders or stages to ensure stable placement and minimize movement during data collection."),
    
    ("Poor Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)", 
     "Problem: Low SNR can occur if the signal from the sample is weak or if there’s too much noise from the environment (e.g., stray light, electronic noise).\n"
     "Solution: \n"
     "- Adjust the integration time to capture more signal (longer integration times can improve SNR).\n"
     "- Use a good optical setup to minimize stray light.\n"
     "- Ensure the spectrometer is shielded from any external light interference.\n"
     "- Adjust the grating or slit width to improve resolution and increase signal intensity."),
    
    ("Data Overload (Large Data Files)", 
     "Problem: Large datasets can become unwieldy, especially if you collect data for many samples or over long periods.\n"
     "Solution: \n"
     "- Manage your data by collecting it in smaller batches or saving it frequently.\n"
     "- If you're working with a large dataset, make sure you're storing the data in formats that are easy to analyze and process (e.g., CSV, Excel).\n"
     "- Use software that can handle large datasets and analyze them in chunks."),
    
    ("Detector Saturation", 
     "Problem: If the intensity of the light source is too high, the CCD detector can become saturated, leading to inaccurate measurements.\n"
     "Solution: \n"
     "- Lower the intensity of the light source.\n"
     "- Adjust the integration time or slit width to avoid overexposing the detector.\n"
     "- Use neutral density filters if necessary to attenuate the light intensity."),
    
    ("Grating and Wavelength Range Selection", 
     "Problem: If the grating isn’t appropriate for your target wavelength range, you might not capture the data you need, or the data may be poorly resolved.\n"
     "Solution: Ensure you are using a grating that matches the wavelength range of your experiment. For Na-S lines, ensure that the grating resolution is fine enough to capture the spectral details."),
    
    ("Spectral Resolution Limitations", 
     "Problem: If your spectrometer's resolution is too low, it may not resolve closely spaced peaks (especially for Raman spectra), which can affect your measurements.\n"
     "Solution: Choose the appropriate resolution for your experiment. Adjust the slit width to balance resolution and signal intensity. If necessary, choose a different grating or adjust the optical system to improve resolution."),
    
    ("Incorrect Peak Identification", 
     "Problem: If you have overlapping peaks or noise, it can be challenging to identify the correct peaks.\n"
     "Solution: Use peak detection algorithms (e.g., find_peaks in Python) to identify peaks in the data automatically. Also, manually inspect the spectra to ensure accurate peak identification."),
    
    ("Environmental Factors", 
     "Problem: Variations in temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors can affect the measurements.\n"
     "Solution: \n"
     "- Try to conduct the experiment in a stable, controlled environment.\n"
     "- Keep the spectrometer in a room with constant temperature and minimal vibration or airflow.\n"
     "- Minimize exposure to strong external light sources that could interfere with the measurements."),
    
    ("Software and Data Analysis", 
     "Problem: After collecting the data, you may encounter difficulties analyzing it, especially if the software used for processing isn’t compatible or is difficult to operate.\n"
     "Solution: \n"
     "- Familiarize yourself with the software beforehand. Ensure it’s properly installed and updated.\n"
     "- Learn how to process the data (e.g., smoothing, peak fitting) to extract the necessary information, such as FWHM or quantum defects."),
    
    ("Maintaining the Spectrometer", 
     "Problem: The spectrometer, like any complex optical instrument, may require regular maintenance. Problems with the detector, grating, or mirror could cause issues during experiments.\n"
     "Solution: Ensure the spectrometer is regularly maintained. If any optical components appear dirty or damaged, clean them (following the manufacturer’s instructions). Contact a technician if the instrument seems to be malfunctioning."),
    
    ("Learning Curve", 
     "Problem: If you are new to using spectrometers, there may be a learning curve to understand all the controls, settings, and data interpretation techniques.\n"
     "Solution: Take time to understand the spectrometer’s manual and the software you’ll be using. Familiarize yourself with the experimental setup, especially how to operate and troubleshoot the spectrometer.")
