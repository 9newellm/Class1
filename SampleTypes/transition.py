# Section 1: Introduction to Atomic Transitions and Spectroscopy
add_section(doc, '1. Understanding Atomic Transitions and Spectroscopy', """
Quantum mechanics plays a crucial role in understanding atomic transitions and the resulting spectra. When an atom absorbs or emits electromagnetic radiation, the energy of the photon corresponds to a difference in the atom’s energy states. These energy levels are quantized and determined by the solutions to the Schrödinger equation for the atom. The transitions between energy levels obey certain selection rules, which dictate the allowed transitions.

For a transition between two states of an atom, the energy difference can be expressed as:
    
    E = h * nu
    
where E is the energy difference, h is Planck’s constant, and nu is the frequency of the emitted or absorbed photon.

#### Selection Rules:
The transition of an electron between two energy levels follows specific selection rules derived from the properties of the atomic wavefunctions, which depend on the angular momentum of the electron. These rules are:
1. The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number (l) must be ±1.
2. The change in the magnetic quantum number (m) can be 0, ±1.
3. The spin quantum number (s) cannot change (Δs = 0).

These rules determine whether a transition is allowed and help predict the spectral lines that will be observed in an emission or absorption spectrum.

# Section 2: Na-S D-Transitions and Quantum Defects
add_section(doc, '2. Fundamental Physics of the Na-Doublet (D-lines)', """
The sodium D-lines, known as the Na D1 and Na D2 lines, are the result of transitions between the excited and ground states of sodium atoms. These transitions involve the electronic configuration 3s^1 for the ground state and 3p^1 for the excited state.

The Na D1 transition corresponds to the 3p^2P1/2 → 3s^2S1/2 transition, and the Na D2 transition corresponds to the 3p^2P3/2 → 3s^2S1/2 transition.

#### Quantum Defects:
Quantum defects arise when the energy levels deviate from the predictions made by the Bohr model due to interactions such as spin-orbit coupling and relativistic effects. For alkali atoms like sodium, these effects modify the energy levels of the excited states and cause shifts in the spectral lines.

The energy of the D1 and D2 lines can be written in terms of the Rydberg constant (R) and the effective nuclear charge (Z_eff) as:
    
    E_n = -R * (Z_eff^2) / n^2

where Z_eff is the effective nuclear charge, and n is the principal quantum number of the electron in the excited state.

The quantum defect for alkali metals can be defined as the difference between the theoretical energy (from the Bohr model) and the observed energy due to these corrections. The quantum defect for sodium is typically small but still influences the precise energy levels.

# Section 3: Experimental Considerations and Spectrometer Setup
add_section(doc, '3. Experimental Considerations in Spectral Imaging', """
In the experiment involving sodium D-lines, a Czerny-Turner type spectrometer is used to disperse light into its component wavelengths. This spectrometer uses a concave mirror and a diffraction grating to separate the different wavelengths of light. The dispersed light is then focused onto a detector, such as a CCD, where the spectrum can be recorded and analyzed.

The resolving power (R) of the spectrometer is crucial in determining how well we can resolve closely spaced spectral lines. The resolving power is given by:

    R = λ / Δλ

where λ is the wavelength of the light, and Δλ is the minimum resolvable difference in wavelength. The higher the resolving power, the finer the details of the spectrum can be observed.

#### Wavelength Calibration:
Accurate wavelength calibration is required to correlate the measured wavelengths with known reference values. This involves using known spectral lines (like the Na D-lines) to calibrate the spectrometer and correct for any instrumental shifts.

# Section 4: Theoretical Calculations and Quantum Defects
add_section(doc, '4. Theoretical Calculations and Quantum Defects', """
To calculate the energy levels and transition probabilities for the sodium D-lines, the Schrödinger equation must be solved for the hydrogen-like potential (since sodium is an alkali metal with a single valence electron). The energy levels for hydrogen-like atoms are given by:

    E_n = -Z^2 * R / n^2

where Z is the atomic number, R is the Rydberg constant, and n is the principal quantum number.

For sodium, the effective nuclear charge, Z_eff, takes into account the shielding of the nucleus by the inner electrons. The effective charge is typically smaller than the atomic number Z (which for sodium is 11) due to this shielding.

The quantum defect (δ) is introduced to correct the energy levels:

    E_n = -R * (Z_eff^2) / (n - δ)^2

The quantum defect is a small correction factor that can be determined experimentally. It arises from the interaction of the valence electron with the core electrons.

The transition probabilities can be calculated using the electric dipole approximation, where the transition matrix element is given by:

    M = ⟨ψ_f | H | ψ_i⟩

where ψ_f and ψ_i are the wavefunctions of the final and initial states, and H is the Hamiltonian of the system. This transition matrix element determines the strength of the transition and the corresponding spectral line intensity.

# Section 5: Data Analysis Techniques
add_section(doc, '5. Data Analysis Techniques', """
Once the spectral data is obtained, several techniques are used to analyze the raw data. The spectral peaks are fitted to models (typically Gaussian or Lorentzian functions) to extract the line positions, intensities, and widths.

#### Line Fitting:
A Gaussian function is often used to fit the spectral lines, particularly when there is Doppler broadening or other factors leading to symmetrical broadening of the spectral lines. The Gaussian function is given by:

    I(λ) = I_0 * exp[-(λ - λ_0)^2 / (2 * σ^2)]

where I_0 is the peak intensity, λ_0 is the central wavelength, and σ is the standard deviation related to the linewidth.

For Lorentzian profiles, the function is:

    I(λ) = I_0 / [1 + ((λ - λ_0) / γ)^2]

where γ is the half-width at half-maximum (HWHM), and λ_0 is the central wavelength.

#### Error Analysis:
In experimental physics, it is essential to estimate uncertainties in measurements. These uncertainties propagate through calculations, affecting the final results. Standard methods for error propagation involve considering both systematic and random errors, which are usually estimated using the least-squares method for fitting experimental data.

The study of sodium’s D-lines, quantum defects, and their associated transition probabilities offers valuable insight into atomic spectroscopy.
