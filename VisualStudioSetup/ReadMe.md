Run OnlyStep_VisualStudio.py and it should get you all the extensions in my visual studio code. 

This include to-date: 

affenwiesel.matlab-formatter
ansenhuang.vscode-view-readme
cweijan.vscode-office
gimly81.matlab
juliencroain.markdown-viewer
mathematic.vscode-latex
mathworks.language-matlab
mjpvs.latex-previewer
ms-python.debugpy
ms-python.python
ms-python.vscode-pylance

Which make viewing word, excel, latex_writing, Read_me, etc easier. Allowing this tool to be used for any general purpose (as a one size fits all file management and computer storage kit) for researchers and those who use code as their base work style flow.
